Welcome! My name's Ori and I'm planning to use this blog to document my research and share the knowledge after I've acquired throughout my career.

# Future Plans

I'm planning to release a couple more full on courses. Currently, *WEB* & *MacOS* courses are in progress and will be available soon! Real life practice labs will also be available shortly.

# Letâ€™s Connect
